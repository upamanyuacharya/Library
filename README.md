# Library
In 10th grade for my board exam project I created a Library system using BlueJ.

This project does a few things.

1: Create Library Card
2: Borrow a Book (Must possess a Library Card)
3: See Your Library Card
4: Donate a Book
5: Return a Borrowed Book

It does this by utilising FileWriter and FileReader to save things like Library Card number (randomly assigned), email, name and borrowed book to individual text files. Each book is one line in another large set of 4 depository text files. The position of the line indicates book Author, Genre, Name and Number in the List. Naturally, the position of each line of data indicates which book it is. So all lines in the 4 txt files that are the 3rd line would belong to the 3rd book, having details of the 3rd book's Author, Genre, Name and Number.

This project was a lot more complicated than it needed to be, at the time, if I do say so myself. However, it as probably worth it as I got 100/100 in ICSE 10th grade Computer Applications.

I didn't know arrays at the time.
